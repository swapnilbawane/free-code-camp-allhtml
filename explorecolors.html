    <h2> Let us explore colors here </h2>

    <hr>
    <strong> There are different ways to represent colors in CSS. 
    Hexadecimal code, or hex code for short. Below paragraph has hex color value of ff6050 </strong>
    
    <p style="color: #ff6050;">
        We usually use decimals, or base 10 numbers, which use the symbols 0 to 9 for each digit. Hexadecimals (or hex) are base 16 numbers. This means it uses sixteen distinct symbols. Like decimals, the symbols 0-9 represent the values zero to nine. Then A,B,C,D,E,F represent the values ten to fifteen. Altogether, 0 to F can represent a digit in hexadecimal, giving us 16 total possible values. 
    </p>

    <p style="color:#ff0066;"> 
        We are mixing colors now. Color is ff0066. To review, hex codes use 6 hexadecimal digits to represent colors, two each for red (R), green (G), and blue (B) components.

        From these three pure colors (red, green, and blue), we can vary the amounts of each to create over 16 million other colors!
        
        For example, orange is pure red, mixed with some green, and no blue. In hex code, this translates to being #FFA500.
        
        The digit 0 is the lowest number in hex code, and represents a complete absence of color.
        
        The digit F is the highest number in hex code, and represents the maximum possible brightness.</p>

        <p style="color:#ff0000">
            We are now using abbreviated hex code. For example red is ff0000. Many people feel overwhelmed by the possibilities of more than 16 million colors. And it's difficult to remember hex code. Fortunately, you can shorten it.

            For example, red's hex code #FF0000 can be shortened to #F00. This shortened form gives one digit for red, one digit for green, and one digit for blue.
            
            This reduces the total number of possible colors to around 4,000. But browsers will interpret #FF0000 and #F00 as exactly the same color.
        </p>

        <p style="color: rgb(10,10,255)"> 
            <strong> Here we are using rgb values for colors. </strong>
            Instead of using six hexadecimal digits like you do with hex code, with RGB you specify the brightness of each color with a number between 0 and 255.

        If you do the math, the two digits for one color equal 16 times 16, which gives us 256 total values. So RGB, which starts counting from zero, has the exact same number of possible values as hex code.

        <i> <u>Just like with hex code, you can mix colors in RGB by using combinations of different values. </i> </u>
