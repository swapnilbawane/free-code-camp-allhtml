    Hello. This displays box shadow.

Hi this is text transform before.

<p class="transformlower">
Hi this is text transform after lowercase.

<p class="transformupper">
    Hi this is text transform after uppercase.

<p class="transformcapitalize">

Apart from it. 
initial will use the default value. 
// inherit will use the text-transform value from parent element. 
// none will use the default: original text.

<p> <strong> Font size </strong>
    The font-size property is used to specify how large the text is in a given element. This rule can be used for multiple elements to create visual consistency of text on a page. In this challenge, you'll set the values for all h1 through h6 tags to balance the heading sizes.
</p>
<p> 
    The font-size property in CSS is not limited to headings, it can be applied to any element containing text.
</p>

<p>
    <strong> Font weight. </strong> 
    Set the font-weight for Multiple Heading Elements
You set the font-size of each heading tag in the last challenge, here you'll adjust the font-weight.

The font-weight property sets how thick or thin characters are in a section of text.

<p class="lineheightforp">
    <strong> Dummy text to check line height in paragraphs. </strong> 
    CSS offers the line-height property to change the height of each line in a block of text. As the name suggests, it changes the amount of vertical space that each line of text gets.

<!-- 
Add a box-shadow to a Card-like Element
The box-shadow property applies one or more shadows to an element.

The box-shadow property takes values for

offset-x (how far to push the shadow horizontally from the element),
offset-y (how far to push the shadow vertically from the element),
blur-radius,
spread-radius and
color, 

in that order.
The blur-radius and spread-radius values are optional.

Multiple box-shadows can be created by using commas to separate properties of each box-shadow element.

Here's an example of the CSS to create multiple shadows with some blur, at mostly-transparent black colors:

box-shadow: 0 10px 20px rgba(0,0,0,0.19), 0 6px 6px rgba(0,0,0,0.23);

<!-- 
The opacity property in CSS is used to adjust the opacity, or conversely, the transparency for an item.

A value of 1 is opaque, which isn't transparent at all.
A value of 0.5 is half see-through.
A value of 0 is completely transparent.
The value given will apply to the entire element, whether that's an image with some transparency, or the foreground and background colors for a block of text.
